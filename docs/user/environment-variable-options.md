## Common

### Logging

Logging is mainly intended for development purposes. See developer docs.

## GUI

### Portable application

*The simulator GUI stores information about currently opened windows, last selected micro-architecture, etc. To make the
simulator fully portable, you have to specify path to a `.ini` file to store this state.*

`QTRVSIM_CONFIG_FILE` - path to `.ini` file with current GUI state.
